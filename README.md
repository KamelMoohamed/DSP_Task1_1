# Sampling-Studio

## A Digital Signal Processing Project signals:
### It has 2 Modes:
>- Browsing signal from .csv file
>- Generating signal with specific Frequency, Amplitude and Phase.
### Every mode of them has some features:
>- Viewing the signal.
>- Sampling the signal with a specific sample rate.
>- Reconstructing signal after sampling.
>- Adding Noise with specific SNR.
>- Adding 2 signals to each other.
>- Deleting Signal.
### Now we will make some scenarios for the features:
#### Scenario #1:
>- Viewing signal
